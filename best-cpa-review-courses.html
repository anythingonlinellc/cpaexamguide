CPAexcel breaks up the lectures, text and multiple choice into bite sized chunks so you are constantly rotating between CPA study activities.

It can still be done just takes a bit of work. This is all being improved shortly according to the Roger Team (as of 8/6/19).</p>

<a href="http://www.cpaexamguide.cpastudyhacks.com/Becker-Com-Discount" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Becker CPA Review</a> is the gold standard name in the CPA review course industry.<br>
                  <br>
                  They have been helping CPA candidates pass the CPA exam since the 1960s and have the most expensive CPA review course
recommended by universities and firms around the world.<br>
                  <br>
                  Becker CPA Review recently re-branded and now offer three levels of service to you: Advantage, Premium and Pro<br>
                  <br>
                  After reviewing each level, I will be focusing on the Premium level product they offer as it is most comparable to the other CPA review courses in the industry in terms of pricing, features provided and software access.<br>
                  <br>

                      <h6>Unlimited Access</h6>
                      <p>After years of limiting software access, Becker CPA review FINALLY gives CPA candidates unlimited access until they pass. This is important because if life gets in the way of the exam, you don't want to scramble to find a new course in the middle of studying.<br>
                        <br>NOTE: This only applies to the Premium and Pro packages. Advantage only offers 24 months access.

                      <h6>Video Lectures + Textbooks + Mobile App</h6>
                      <p>Written materials are top notch with plenty of examples and mnemonics and the lectures are fairly engaging and alibeit super corny at times will keep you focused. The lectures do run a bit longer than most other CPA review courses. Everything can also be accessed and used on their mobile app for complete freedom as you study.</p>

                      <p>Multiple choice explanations are excellent and will help you truly understand why a question is right or wrong.</p>

                      <h6>Success Coach & Tutoring</h6>
                      <p>Depending on the Becker package you choose you may have access to a CPA exam success coach and/or 5 hours of 1-on-1 tutoring. <br><br>This isn't quite at the same level as a <a href="https://www.cpaexamguide.com/learn/uceg-method-info/" target="_blank">CPA exam mentor</a>, but it certainly helps to have additional help.</p>

					  <div class="panels-item col-sm-6"> <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok text-color-theme"></span>
                      <h6> LiveOnline Classroom</h6>
                      <p>With the Premium and Pro Packages, you now have access to sign up to join online lecture series instead of commuting to a live location. This is a huge time saver and you will receive the same structure of being in a live classroom with the ability to watch replays. I still do not recommend the live classroom option as it is just too inefficient for most CPA candidates and quality of instructors is hit or miss.<br>

                      <h6> Price</h6>
                      <p>Becker CPA Review is still the most premiumly priced course in the industry, unless they are <a href="becker-cpa-review-discounts">offering a discount.</a> If you are paying out of pocket be sure to compare Becker to other CPA review courses to ensure it's the right fit for you or use their payment plans to spread your expense. I do like the Advantage package they offer which starts at $2,399 for budget-minded CPA candidates, just don't expect unlimited access to the software or access to their final review or success coaches.

					  <div class="panels-item col-sm-6"> <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-remove text-color-theme-red"></span>
                      <h6> Standard Customer Service</h6>
                      <p>According to their website, they have very limited hours on the weekend. Expect 2 full business days for a response per their website. The majority of students study during the weekend and need a quick response which in my opinion shouldn't be more than 24 hours. When sending in an email I would recommend you batch your questions together to speed up the process.<br>

                <p>After diving into Yaeger CPA Review course I have found that they are one of the best (if not the best) at providing you with the tools you need to learn each and every AICPA blueprint content group.</p>
                <p>After chatting with Phil Yaeger, CPA and his team, I found that they have built their course from the ground up using the AICPA blueprint in a way that I don't see other courses doing.</p>
                <p>When there is a significant shift in the importance of multiple choice questions, you need a course that is more than just a fancy test bank.</p>
                <p>You need a course that will actually teach you what you need to know so that you can master the much more complex CPA exam simulations and written communications that now make up half of each section of the CPA exam.</p>
                <p>Read on below to determine if Yaeger CPA Review is a good fit for you.</p>

                      <h6>Video Lectures</h6>
                      <p>While the quality of the lectures are great, the lecturers themselves I found to be dry compared to other review course instructors in the industry (compare to <a href="review-courses/roger">Roger CPA Review</a>).&nbsp;But they keep them short and no longer than 15 minutes a piece which is perfect for keeping your attention.</p>

                      <h6>Analytics</h6>
                      <p>Yaeger's multiple choice analytics are broken out by content groups, but are a bit limited compared to Gleim CPA Review or Wiley CPAexcel.</p>

                      <h6>Flashcards</h6>
                      <p>While having flashcards is great, you can't organize them by topic or content group. Really only useful if you have gone through the entire course. Per Yaeger this is getting an update later in the year.</p>

                <p>Wiley CPAexcel gives you everything you need to pass the CPA exam with the help of their instructors such as Pam Smith, CPA and Greg Carnes, CPA.</p>
                <p>Based on my experience using their CPA study software, CPA exam mobile apps, Wiley CPA online test bank, and printed/electronic flashcards, <em><strong>Wiley CPAexcel helps you study smarter based on your study personality.</strong></em><strong> </strong></p>
                <p>The shining feature of Wiley CPAexcel is that<strong> <em>they understand you don't have time to sit through 3-4 hour lectures</em></strong>. </p>
                <p>They split up all of there video lectures into "bite-sized" increments and give you the ability to access their course via smart phone or your computer and it all stays synced up so you can truly study anywhere at anytime. </p>
                <p>Lastly, the best feature of all three products offered by Wiley CPAexcel (includes Silver, Video Gold Medal, and Platinum) is that their course <strong><em>does not expire until a year after you pass!</em></strong></p>

                  <br>
                  When my other review course expired, I would not have been able to pass without the help of Dr. Gleim and his team... <br>
                  <br>
                  I found that Gleim CPA Review is <strong>best suited for students/professionals</strong> who want thousands of multiple choice, the most simulations, a Personal CPA Counselor, and need full access to the course until you pass. <br>
                  <br>
                  Gleim has introduced video classroom lectures for all four sections of the CPA exam. With this new addition, Gleim now offers you all of the same features of a $3,400 course, but for a third of the cost!<br>
                  <br>
                <strong>If you learn best by teaching yourself with the help of video lectures and by doing thousands of multiple choice questions</strong> then Gleim is without a doubt your best bet.</p>

                      <h6> Reputation</h6>
                      <p>Fast Forward Academy is very popular in the Enrolled Agent industry and is still fairly new to the CPA industry. I think their price point makes them very attractive and the improvements to their course in 2018 makes me confident it will be a course that generates a lot of chatter. I will keep this review updated as I start to hear more success stories. (Please let me know bryan@cpaexamguide.com if you have a success story you want to share)</p>

        <h4>My MDS CPA Review Rating Summary</h4>
        <p>Steve Martin has developed a comprehensive in-house CPA review course that I believe has potential to become one of the better review courses currently available. Especially if you live in Ohio and are able to attend Steve's live courses which are where his course is at its best.<br>
          <br>
          His online course lacks a good tracking system to monitor your multiple choice progress which puts it behind many of the other review courses, but Steve has still taken the best parts of Becker and condensed them into 72+ hours of lectures and 5,000+ multiple choice.<strong><br>
          <br>
          BONUS: </strong>I had an opportunity to interview Steve and I really think you will enjoy our conversation. <strong><a href="https://www.cpaexamguide.com/learn/cpa-discipline/" target="_blank">Listen Here</a></strong></p>

        <p>Ninja CPA Review is currently run by Jeff Elliott of Another71.com (most popular CPA exam forum). The Ninja CPA Review product line contains study notes, audio notes, and a test bank of multiple choice and simulations that were built by Jeff and his team based on the released AICPA CPA exam questions and unofficial answer key. After reviewing the products offered I absolutely recommend them for any candidate who needs some extra study supplements or fresh multiple choice (see supplements listed below), but at this time can't recommend Ninja CPA review as a primary CPA review course when compared to Roger CPA review, Wiley CPAexcel or Gleim CPA Review because of how outdated the Bisk video lectures are.</p>

        <p>As you know, the CPA review courses above get their questions from the same AICPA released questions. </p>
        <p>The key difference is in how the questions are explained and the quality of their multiple choice analytics which will be used by you to identify where to spend your time studying. </p>

                <br>
                I personally would not be a CPA today if it wasn't for the fresh multiple choice that Gleim CPA Review offered and here's why. I had already gone through my entire primary CPA review course twice before it expired and here's what happened. I had memorized all the answers to the multiple choice questions.<br>
                <br>
                It gave me a false confidence that I &quot;Understood&quot; the material but the reality was that I had just memorized which option was correct. So instead of renewing my primary CPA review course I invested in a CPA exam test bank with fresh multiple choice questions. This way I was truly testing myself on the material instead of just regurgitating what I had memorized. </p>
    <p class="blog-post-content">Currently, I only recommend three companies who offer testbanks that you can purchase separately: Wiley CPAexcel Yaeger CPA Review, and Gleim. Luckily, these are the best test banks on the market anyway. 🙂</p>
