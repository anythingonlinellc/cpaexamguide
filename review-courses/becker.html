        <h2 class="h2-23em"><strong>What You Need To Pass The CPA Exam</strong></h2> </div>
		  
		  <div class="container container-filter">
		    <p>&nbsp;</p>
		    <p>Now before we even start discussing what Becker CPA Review offers, let's take a mile high view of exactly what you need to pass the CPA exam and break down each specific resource.</p>
		    <p>Regardless of whether you use Becker CPA Review or not.</p>
			  <h3>Resource #1:</h3>
		    <p>The primary resource you need to pass the CPA exam is <strong>TIME</strong>.</p>
	  </div>
		  <div class="container container-filter text-center"> <img src="../images/UCEG-method/2 TIME-FOCUS2.jpg" width="440" height="400" class="img-responsive p-center image-shadow" alt=""/></div>
	  <div class="container container-filter">
		    <p>&nbsp;</p>
		    <p>Without it you will never be able to pass the CPA exam. </p>
		    <p>You also need to understand that there are difficult sacrifices that will need to be made, distractions you need to avoid and relationships that will need to be handled as you study.</p>
		    <p>You also want to make sure you have a CPA Review Course that is going to be efficient and work with your life style. </p>
		    <p>For example, if you travel a lot then you will need a course that is mobile and you can take on the go and use regardless of the device you have in front of you.</p>
		    <p>This course also needs to be in sync between all your devices at all times. </p>
		    <p><strong>Fun Fact: </strong>Becker CPA Review has this ability with <a href="http://www.cpaexamguide.cpastudyhacks.com/Roger-Deep-Trial" target="_blank">Mobile App</a> that gives you the ability to study anywhere at anytime.</p>
	    <h3>Resource #2:</h3>
	    <p>The next resource you need to pass the CPA exam is obviously a <strong>CPA REVIEW COURSE</strong>. </p>
		    <p>But there is much more to it than just picking any old course that is available.</p>
		    <p>And please don't make the rookie mistake I made and just assume because a CPA review course is expensive it is the best for your specific situation.</p>
	  </div>
		  <div class="container container-filter text-center"> <img src="../images/UCEG-method/1 COURSE.-FOCUS.jpg" width="440" height="400" class="img-responsive p-center image-shadow" alt=""/></div>
	  <div class="container container-filter">
	    <p>&nbsp;</p>
		    <p>Now because you are unique and learn in a unique way, you need to find a CPA course that caters to your study personality. </p>
		    <p><a href="https://quiz.cpaexamguide.com/sf/d9addd22" target="_blank">(If you don't know your study personality yet, take this 45 second quiz.)</a></p>
		    <p>Meaning, if you are a visual learner who learns best in a classroom environment then you want a course that has excellent lectures. </p>
	    <p>On the other hand, if you are more of a self-studier then you want a course that has a strong textbook and test bank with good lectures to back it up if needed.</p>
	    <p><strong>Fun Fact #2:</strong> Becker CPA Review has some of the <a href="http://www.cpaexamguide.cpastudyhacks.com/Roger-Deep-Trial" target="_blank">best lectures and a thorough textbook and test bank as well</a>.</p>
	    <p>You also need a CPA review course that is going to give you the support you need to learn and understand the AICPA Blueprints so that you can be prepared on exam day.</p>
	    <p>This support can be in the form of email or calling customer support but also the ease of using the courses software.</p>
		  <h3>Resource #3:</h3>
	    <p>The final resource that you need to quickly pass the CPA exam is a <strong>CPA EXAM MENTOR</strong>. </p>
	  </div>
		  <div class="container container-filter text-center"> <img src="../images/UCEG-method/3 MENTOR-FOCUS.jpg" width="440" height="400" class="img-responsive p-center image-shadow" alt=""/></div>
		  <div class="container container-filter">
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>A CPA exam mentor is someone who has experience passing the CPA Exam, someone who teach you how to optimize your time and your CPA review course and someone who can provide you with community and personally help you when the going gets tough.</p>
        <p><strong>Fun Fact: </strong>Becker CPA Review offers CPA exam coaching and tutoring with their Premium and Pro packages which we will discuss below.</p>
        <p>This is a great start but are still very reactive service.</p>
        <p>It relies on you to ask the right questions and it also lacks the community aspect of what a CPA exam mentor provides.</p>
        <p>A CPA exam mentor is a proactive member of your team who teaches you before the going gets tough and gives you a step by step plan to follow, instead of giving you advice before it's too late.</p>

			  <h3>What Happens Next?</h3>
        <p>Now what happens when you have time, a CPA review course and a CPA exam mentor?</p>
        <p>Well three specific things occur...</p>
      </div>

        <h3><strong>Is Becker CPA Review's Dashboard Functional?</strong></h3>
        <p>Becker CPA Review offers a very clean and easy to navigate interface.</p>
        <p>Their mobile app and desktop software are fully integrated and you are able to study on any device you want anywhere you have an internet connection.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3><strong>How Does Becker CPA Review's Study Planner Compare To Others?</strong></h3>
        <p>The Becker Study Planner is fully customizable and helps keep you on schedule as you progress through the material.</p>
        <p>I didn't find any issues with changing the dates or customizing the planner based on a CPA candidates schedule.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3><strong>How Can I Expect To Use Becker CPA Review?</strong></h3>
        <p>Becker CPA Review is very organized and each content group is now broken down into modules which make the course much easier to digest then being in large 3-4 hour chunks.</p>
        <p>The organization has you follow a step by step process as follows for each module:</p>
        <p>1) Take a pre-assessment</p>
        <p>2) Watch the lecture</p>
        <p>3) Take a Skills Practice over the content</p>
        <p>4) Complete multiple choice questions</p>
        <p>More on this process later in the review...</p>

        <p><br>
        </p>
        <h3><strong>What Is Adapt2U?</strong></h3>
        <p>The trend in the CPA review course industry is to come up with buzzwords to market their products in a way that differeniates themselves from other courses.</p>
        <p>Becker CPA Review is no different.</p>
        <p>They coined the term &quot;Adapt2U.&quot;</p>
        <p>Which is supposed to be their form of adaptive learning.</p>
        <p>It's a pre-assessment that you take prior to each module made up of multiple choice questions.</p>
        <p>If you score really high, their system assumes you &quot;understand&quot; the material and recommends that you can skip the lecture and so forth.</p>
        <p>But the thing is and the <a href="https://www.aicpa.org/becomeacpa/cpaexam/examinationcontent.html" target="_blank">AICPA</a> has even said this themselves, multiple choice are not a good gauge of your understanding.</p>
        <p>So take their Adapt2U system with a grain of salt and understand that you may guess on a multiple choice question and get it right or even worse, get a question right for the wrong reason and then their adaptive system might think you understand the material.        </p>
        <h3><strong>NEW FEATURE: Skills Practice Modules</strong></h3>
        <p>Where Becker does shine is in their Skills Practice Modules.</p>
        <p>For each section, you will have a &quot;Skills Practice Module&quot; walkthrough of an example simulations.</p>
        <p>This simulation will test you on the various skill levels you will be tested on the CPA exam.</p>
        <p>This feature is unique to the industry and shows that Becker is on top of its game to preparing you for understanding the AICPA blueprints.        </p>
        <p>As you are probably well aware, the AICPA is focusing on testing CPA candidates based on <a href="https://www.journalofaccountancy.com/news/2015/oct/cpa-exam-next-generation-201513176.html" target="_blank">higher learning skills</a> instead of just the basic memorizing and understanding skills that multiple choice test you on.</p>
        <p>For each Skills Practice Module you will have an instructor walk you through the simulation and you will be able to take the practice question as well to test your understanding.</p>
        <p>This is an excellent way to apply key concepts that you should have just learned from their video lectures and/or textbook.</p>
        <p>It is also a powerful feature to utilize when you are in final review mode and have a strong understanding of the material.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3><strong>Quality of CPA Exam Questions</strong></h3>
        <p>Now the important question to ask is do the CPA exam questions offered teach you the blueprints and actually prepare you for the real thing.</p>
        <p>Becker offers several thousand multiple choice and simulations which is more than enough to use to pass the CPA exam.</p>
        <p>I also found that their question explanations were some of the best in the business, which is important if you are someone who learns well from answering questions and teaching yourself from the answers.</p>
        <p>I also found that the questions line up well with the specific AICPA blueprint that is discussed in the module.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3><strong>How Are Becker CPA Review's Mock Exams?</strong></h3>
        <p>Becker CPA Review also provides you with 12 Simulated Mock Exams to prep you for exam day.</p>
        <p>As you know the CPA exam is dynamic based on how you perform per testlet so it's difficult for CPA review courses to predict how your experience will be.</p>
        <p>I believe Becker does a decent job of re-creating the CPA exam experience which is good practice for you.</p>
        <p>It's great that they give you this tool to use to also practice on your time management.</p>
        <p>So use them knowing that the CPA exam will likely be different then what you see on the Mock Exam but that it's not really the point.</p>
        <p>It's more about getting you comfortable with time management and understanding how the exam actually works and functions.</p>

        </p>
        <h3><strong>How Does Becker CPA Review's Video Lectures Compare?</strong></h3>
        <p>Becker CPA Review utilizes multiple lecturers to cover the material.</p>
        <p>Each lecturer is an expert in the field that they are discussing.</p>
        <p>Some instructors are more entertaining and energetic than others.</p>
        <p>It's difficult to making CPA exam topics interesting and if you are a fan of corny jokes then you will probably be able to tolerate most of the instructors.</p>
        <p>Compared to <a href="wiley-cpaexcel.html">Wiley CPAexcel</a>, <a href="yaeger.html">Yaeger CPA Review</a> and <a href="roger.html">Roger CPA Review</a>, Becker CPA Review's lecture are on the longer side.</p>
        <p>I found that they typically range in the 40-60 minute range, most other courses focus on getting close to the 15-20 minute mark.</p>
        <p>So depending on your ability to focus for long periods of time and how important video lectures are to <a href="https://quiz.cpaexamguide.com/sf/d9addd22">your study personality</a>, then I would give each course a try to get a taste for the instructor teaching style works best for you.</p>
        <p>In terms of functionality, the Becker lectures are the classic watch the lecture and highlight as you go.</p>
        <p>The video + text are automatically synced up which is nice so that you don't have to manually figure out where you are in the text.</p>
        <p>You can also speed up the lecture speed and use closed captions.</p>
        <p>You are also able to leave digital notes and annotations</p>
        <h3><strong>Personaly Story:</strong></h3>
        <p>Now it's important to note that if you are like me and more of a self-studier with a short attention span, these lectures are counter productive.</p>
        <p>I found that I would watch the lectures and not really retain anything and then have to go back into the text to re-teach myself the material.</p>
        <p>So essentially I was doubling the time I was spending studying.</p>
        <p>So just be aware that because Becker tells you to watch a lecture that you don't have too if it's not the most efficient way for you to study.</p>
        <p>What worked for me was to start in the text and the questions, then use lectures as a reference for topics I couldn't figure out on my own.</p>
        <p>This is why <a href="https://quiz.cpaexamguide.com/sf/d9addd22">understanding your study personality</a> is crucial to your success.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3><strong>LiveOnline and Live In-Person Lectures</strong></h3>
        <p>New for 2019, Becker CPA Review now offers BOTH live online and Live in-person lectures.</p>
        <p>If you are someone who lacks structure and needs a place to be to complete the Becker CPA Review lectures then this option will be crucial for your success.</p>
        <p>Personally I would focus on using the LiveOnline option because it eliminates the need for your commute and all of the lectures are recorded just in case you missed a lecture.</p>
        <p>I've also heard from my viewers that the live classroom instructors are hit or miss depending on their experience.</p>
        <p>So as you weigh both options, please consider commute time and the fact that you can easily watch the lectures from home and be much more efficient.</p>
        <p>FYI - these options are not available for the Becker Advantage package. LiveOnline is available for the Premium &amp; Pro package but in person live classroom is only available for the Pro package customers.</p>

        <h3><strong>Are Becker CPA Review's Flashcards Worth It?</strong></h3>
        <p>Becker CPA Review offers both physical and digital flashcards.</p>
        <p>When I was studying for the CPA exam the Becker CPA flashcards were a staple of my study and review time.</p>
        <p>I liked how organized and focused they were and absolutely helped me grasp topics in question.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately now that Simulations are 50% of your score flashcards really only help you with the lower level skills.</p>
        <p>So while very useful for memorizing they won't necessarily be effective in helping in your analyzing and evaluation skills.</p>
        <p>FYI - All packages offer the digital cards, but only Pro Level customers receive the printed flashcards.</p>
        <p>You also don't have the option to create your own flashcards in the Becker software, unlike <a href="roger.html">Roger CPA Review</a>.<br>

        <h3><strong>It Finally Happened!</strong></h3>
        <p>Not sure if it was my review or just the intense competition in the CPA review course industry, but Becker CPA Review finally offers unlimited access until you pass.</p>
        <p>Here's why this is important.</p>
        <p>Back when I used Becker, I only had 12 months access to the software.</p>
        <p>Well life got in the way and it took me 28 months to pass the exam...</p>
        <p>I was in the middle of studying when I lost access to Becker and had to scramble to find another review course in the middle of studying.</p>
        <p>It was unnecessary stress.</p>
        <p>Now Becker CPA Review is still by far the most expensive course out there but at least they will stick with you until you pass.</p>
        <p><strong>NOTE: </strong>You should also be aware that unlimited access only applies to their &quot;Premium and Pro Packages.&quot; The &quot;Advantage&quot; Becker package has the standard 24 month access limit that includes the Becker Pass Promise.</p>
        <p><strong>NOTE 2: </strong>I'm still not a fan of the Becker Pass Promise. In order to qualify you have to complete an certain % of the course and get a certain number of questions right. In my opinion this forces you to focus on completing the course only and not what's actually important. Making sure you understand the material. If you are approaching the 24 month access period you will start trying to get questions right just for the sake of getting them right which is dangerous to your success. Now 24 months is a long time and if you use a <a href="https://www.ultimatecpaexamguide.com/" target="_blank">CPA exam mentor</a>, then you will greatly increase your odds of passing within 24 months. Becker has also told me that they will work with you to extend your access if needed but it will be for a fee, but be sure to contact their customer support to ensure you understand their terms.</p>

              <p><strong>Basic Customer Support - Advantage Package Customers</strong></p>
              <p>As with any large company customer support becomes a challenge.</p>
              <p>Becker CPA Review is no different.</p>
              <p>They do offer phone + chat + email + message board support from the times of:</p>
              <p>Mon - Fri: 7:30 am – 7:30 pm CST | Saturday: 9:00 am - 1:00 pm CST</p>
              <p>However getting a response on the weekends is very rare which is when most of your questions will come up.</p>
              <p>Expect anywhere from a 24-72 hour wait for a response on a non-weekday.              </p>
              <h3><strong>Premium Customer Support Options:</strong></h3>
              <p><strong>CPA Exam Success Coaches</strong></p>
              <p>At this time I don't have much information on what a CPA exam success coach provides or how it's provided, but I can tell you that if you invest in the Premium or Pro Becker packages you will have email and phone support from your success coach who can answer any questions related to how to sign up for the exam and other questions you may have about taking the CPA exam.</p>
              <p><strong>CPA Exam One On One Tutoring</strong></p>
              <p>If you need hands on technical advice, if you invest in the Pro Package, you will have 5 one hour sessions available to have a one on one video meeting with a CPA exam expert who can teach you anything you are struggling with understanding.</p>
              <p>This is a great option for folks who have been out of college for several years and know they will need more hands on help on topics he/she can't teach themselves.</p>

        <p>Becker CPA Review should work for the majority of CPA candidates.</p>
        <p>You can tailor the course to be used regardless of your study personality.</p>
        <p>The differences really are how much are you willing to spend on a CPA review course.</p>
        <p>If your firm is sponsoring you to invest in Becker then I say go for it. </p>
        <p>But if you are shelling out $2,399-$3,499 for Becker out of your own pocket then I would say make absolutely sure you have compared Becker to the other courses to ensure it's right for you.</p>
