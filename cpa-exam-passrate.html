        <p>By the end of this article you will be armed with 15 fool  proof methods for motivating even the most stubborn accounting students to take  the CPA exam and will debunk the most common excuses accounting students make for  NOT even trying to sit for the CPA exam.<br>
          <br>
Why is this important you may ask? <br>
<br>
I was recently part of an accounting career fair and I was approached by a 4th  year accounting student and she looked me square in the eyes, squinted and  asked me to &ldquo;convince&rdquo; her why she should take the CPA exam.<br>
<br>
As I stood there with my mouth wide open, I was completely speechless and  couldn&rsquo;t believe that I had to explain the <a href="study-tips#1">vast benefits of why passing the CPA  exam</a> is crucial to having a successful accounting career.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately statistics are showing this mindset is becoming more prevalent on  college campuses:<br>
<br>
According to this <a href="http://www.journalofaccountancy.com/news/2015/may/take-the-cpa-exam-201512308.html" target="_blank">Journal Of Accountancy</a> article, in the year 2015 only 78% of  accounting majors express interest in taking the CPA exam and only 70% are  actually sitting for the CPA exam.<br>
<br>
Additionally, as stated by the AICPA President, CEO Barry Melancon in his <a href="http://blog.aicpa.org/2014/12/aicpa-president-and-ceo-looks-ahead-to-2015.html" target="_blank">12/2014 CPA Letter  Daily</a><br>
<br>
<em>&ldquo;We have had about six consecutive years  of record numbers of people majoring in accounting. That&rsquo;s a great thing. For  the last three years, however, we&rsquo;ve basically had a level number of people  taking the CPA exam. So there is a gap that&rsquo;s building.&rdquo;</em></p>
        <p>This is understandable when you look at the pass rates of the CPA exam for 2016 &amp; 2017:</p>

        PROBLEM</strong> <br>
        Students don’t understand how passing the CPA exam will give them immediate results.<br>
          <strong><img src="images/cpa-exam-passrate/solution.jpg" width="50" height="50" alt=""/><br>
          SOLUTION</strong> <br>
          Create an emotional connection with your students by sharing personally how the CPA exam changed your life using the Incremental Growth Method.<br>
          <strong><img src="images/cpa-exam-passrate/time.png" width="50" height="50" alt=""/><br>
          ESTIMATED TIME</strong> <br>
          10 minute class discussion</p></div><p><br>
            The most obvious benefit to passing the CPA exam is that CPAs will likely <a href="http://www.becker.com/cpa-review/resources/career-opportunities/what-you-can-earn-as-a-cpa" target="_blank">make  $1 million dollars</a> more over their career than a Non-CPA.<br>
            <br>
Unfortunately I have found that this is NOT the best motivation for convincing accounting students to take the CPA exam.<br>
<br>
The problem with sharing this data with your students is that  to them one million dollars  is not immediate benefit.<br>
<br>
College students (with mountains of student loan debt) need to see short term benefits in order to motivate them to take the CPA exam as soon as possible. <br>
            <br>
            This is why the Incremental Growth Method is one my most effective motivational tactics.<br>
<br>
What I love about this method is that it immediately puts the results that can  be obtained from passing the CPA exam and working in public accounting into  perspective. 
          <h3><strong><br>
          Step By Step Example of  Incremental Growth Method:</strong></h3>
        <p>Instead of telling my readers  that  if they pass the CPA exam they will likely make $1 million more over their  career than a non-CPA, I shared my annual salary information  as a non-CPA and the results I had after I passed the CPA exam.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>1)</strong> My Pre-CPA salary = $40K/yr as a client accountant<br>
  <br>
</p>
        </p>
        <div class="state-button-center" ><img src="https://www.cpaexamguide.com/learn/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/2010-w2.jpg" alt="" width="494" height="482" class="img-responsive"/></div>
        <p><br>
  <br>
          <strong>2)</strong> My Salary after 2 months of passing the CPA exam = $54K/yr as a PwC Experienced Auditor<br>
  <br>
  </p>
        <div class="state-button-center" ><img src="https://www.cpaexamguide.com/learn/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/2012-w2.jpg" alt="" width="494" height="482" class="img-responsive"/></div>
        <p><br>
          <br>
          3) My Salary at end of Year 2 of being a CPA = $65K/yr as an Assistant VP of Financial Reporting at CitiMortgage<br>
          <br>
        </p>
        <div class="state-button-center" ><img src="https://www.cpaexamguide.com/learn/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/2013-w2.jpg" alt="" width="494" height="482" class="img-responsive"/></div>
        <p><br>
          <br>
          By providing my readers  with real  scans of my W-2&rsquo;s (with personal info blacked out of course!) it shows them my real results and the type of positions I held and how I obtained them.<br>
          <br>
          By doing this I create an emotional connection with my readers who may be on  the fence about whether they should take the CPA exam or not.<br>
          <br>
          To most college students, $1 million dollars isn&rsquo;t a  real number that they can comprehend, but $25K is a number that they  immediately can connect with emotionally based on the fact that student loans,  mortgages and weddings etc… are on the horizon.<br>
        <h3><strong>What You Can Do</strong></h3>
        
        <p>Here is the step by step system that you can use to implement the Incremental Growth Method in your classroom:<br>
<br>
        <div class="steps" >
            <p><strong>Step #1: Real Results</strong><br>
              Show real results of what  happened to a specific person after passing the CPA exam, avoid vague benefits. Be specific and use real life examples if possible.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Step #2: Emotional Connection</strong> <br>
              Ensure there is an  emotional connection between the student and the results that you show.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Step #3: The Big Reveal</strong> <br>
              Reveal how passing the CPA exam can skyrocket their career and salary via promotions, jumping positions or even career paths.</p>
        </div>
          <p><br>
          As teachers/professors you all have unique  stories and backgrounds. <br>
          <br>
        I highly recommend looking back at what happened to  your career after you passed the CPA exam or feel free to use my case study! <br>

        Intangible CPA Exam Benefits Technique</strong></h2>

          <p><strong><img src="images/cpa-exam-passrate/problem-icon.png" width="50" height="50" alt=""/><br>
            PROBLEM</strong> <br>
            Students don&rsquo;t know any benefits for becoming a CPA  other than making more money.<br>
            <strong><img src="images/cpa-exam-passrate/solution.jpg" width="50" height="50" alt=""/><br>
              SOLUTION</strong> <br>
              Share these 4 additional benefits to passing the CPA exam that (I  believe) outweigh the benefit of making more money.<br>
            <strong><img src="images/cpa-exam-passrate/time.png" width="50" height="50" alt=""/><br>
              ESTIMATED TIME</strong> <br>
              10-15 minute class discussion</p>
        </div>
        <p><br>
        As mentioned in Strategy #1, the key to creating urgency for your accounting students to take the CPA exam is to reveal the short term benefits of becoming a CPA.
<br>
<br>
 This is why it is so crucial to explain that there are more benefits to passing  the CPA exam than just making a lot of money.<br>
<br>
There are 4 other intangible benefits that I share with all of my students that helps put  perspective into WHY passing the CPA exam is so important for their careers  long term success.
<br></p>
<h3><strong>Benefit #1: Job security</strong></h3>
 <p>As someone who lost his first job due to the economy in April of 2009 and  the fact that I hadn&rsquo;t passed the CPA exam, job security was my #1 concern.  <br>
   <br>
   Obtaining your CPA exam is  the absolute best way to ensure that you retain your job when cuts have to be  made can be a very motivating factor when a student is considering taking the  CPA exam or not.<br>
 </p>
 
 <h3><strong>Benefit  #2: Professional Recognition</strong></h3>
          <p>Be sure to explain to your students that as a  CPA you are held to a higher standard, but being a CPA is also like being in an  exclusive club. <br>
            <br>
            Almost every industry understands that the CPA exam license is  an elite certification. They know without even meeting the individual that as a CPA he/she would be an extremely motivated and determined  individual.<br>
          </p>
        <h3><strong>Benefit #3: Career Development</strong></h3>
          <p>Remind students that if they want to fast track their career that the CPA  exam is a crucial key to this puzzle. <br>
            <br>
            As more and more professionals are  getting their MBA or Masters, it is becoming more difficult to stand out in the  crowd. <br>
            <br>
            Obtaining a CPA license is like a golden ticket to getting a  promotion  or finding a better job elsewhere.<br>
            <br>
          </p>
        <h3><strong>Benefit #4: Career Flexibility</strong></h3>
          <p>Career flexibility is one of my favorite benefits of the becoming a CPA. <br>
            <br>
            I  have friends who went from public accounting to the FBI, to teaching, and  working for start-ups all because they passed the CPA exam and used it as a  tool to get where he/she wanted to go. <br>
            <br>
            Always remind students that in 10+ years   accounting may no longer be interesting or challenging to them,  and without the CPA license it is much more difficult to jump career paths. <br>
            <br>

        CPA Exam Is Too Expensive</strong></h2>
        <div class="problem-solution" >
          <p><strong><img src="images/cpa-exam-passrate/problem-icon.png" width="50" height="50" alt=""/><br>
            PROBLEM</strong> <br>
            Some students make the common excuse that they can&rsquo;t afford to sit for the CPA exam.<br>
            <strong><img src="images/cpa-exam-passrate/solution.jpg" width="50" height="50" alt=""/><br>
              SOLUTION</strong> <br>
              Show your students that the CPA exam is not an expense, but a long  term investment that will reap dividends for their entire career.<br>
            <strong><img src="images/cpa-exam-passrate/time.png" width="50" height="50" alt=""/><br>
              ESTIMATED TIME</strong> <br>
              10 minute one on one or class discussion</p>
        </div>
        <p><br>
With student loans being the focal point of this presidential election, the  cost of education is on the minds of today&rsquo;s accounting students.<br>
<br>
The fact that the CPA exam itself costs close to $1,000 and a quality CPA  review course will cost between $1,000-$3,300, it doesn&rsquo;t leave a lot of  breathing room for many student&rsquo;s bank accounts.<br>
<br>
However this is a dangerous misconception that I find myself dealing with on  almost a daily basis.<br>
<br>
Example Email:<br>
<br><div class="state-button-center" ><img src="images/cpa-exam-passrate/cheap.png" alt="" width="551" height="257" class="img-responsive"/></div>
<p><br>
  <br>
  Emails  like this make me cringe…<br>
  <br>
  Students who try to cheap out on CPA exam materials will often fail because  they don&rsquo;t have all the tools they need to pass.<br>
  <br>
  When candidates &quot;cheap out&quot; on a CPA review course that doesn't give them enough to pass the CPA exam, they end up spending more money overall with additional CPA exam fees for re-taking sections of the exam.<br>
  <br>
  Remind your budget minded students that the CPA exam will pay dividends for the rest of their career. <br>
  <br>
  The idea of not spending $2K-$3K on the CPA exam now will actually cost them  tens of thousands of dollars every year in lost income potential if they fail to sit for the CPA exam immediately after college.<br>
  <br>
  Please don&rsquo;t let your students fall into this trap.<br>

          <p><strong><img src="images/cpa-exam-passrate/problem-icon.png" width="50" height="50" alt=""/><br>
            PROBLEM</strong> <br>
            Some students are convinced they aren&rsquo;t smart enough to pass the CPA exam and use that as an excuse to not even TRY to take the CPA exam.<br>
            <strong><img src="images/cpa-exam-passrate/solution.jpg" width="50" height="50" alt=""/><br>
              SOLUTION</strong> <br>
              Remind them that the CPA exam is NOT an IQ exam, but requires taking  it one day at a time.<br>
            <strong><img src="images/cpa-exam-passrate/time.png" width="50" height="50" alt=""/><br>
              ESTIMATED TIME</strong> <br>
              5-10 minute class discussion</p>
        </div>
        <p><br>
          The CPA exam is the most overwhelming exam that any accounting student will  encounter.<br>
<br>
I have seen students with 4.0 GPAs who are presidents of Beta Alpha Psi fail  the CPA exam multiple times and give up, and I have seen average students with sub  3.0 GPAs pass the CPA exam on their first try.<br>
<br>
The CPA exam is not so much how SMART you are or your GPA, but has  everything to do with how mentally prepared you are and what you are willing to  sacrifice in order to pass.<br>
<br>
Remind your students that if they  are able to graduate and complete the education requirements to sit for  the CPA exam then they are able to pass the CPA exam with the proper motivation.<br>
<br>
A great way to break the ice would be to ask your class out right to raise  their hands if any of them don't plan on taking the CPA exam and then ask them why.<br>

            PROBLEM</strong> <br>
            Students don&rsquo;t take the time to understand how they learn and instead create  busy work for themselves.<br>
            <strong><img src="images/cpa-exam-passrate/solution.jpg" width="50" height="50" alt=""/><br>
              SOLUTION</strong> <br>
              Use the Learning Man Method to help them identify how they learn best  which will help them save time and money when it comes time to sit for the CPA  exam.<br>
            <strong><img src="images/cpa-exam-passrate/time.png" width="50" height="50" alt=""/><br>
              ESTIMATED TIME</strong> <br>
              1-4 hours for students to test on their own</p>
        </div>
        <p><br>
          The majority of students fail the CPA exam because they don&rsquo;t know how they  learn best and end up creating busy work for themselves instead of efficient  studying.<br>
<br>
This is why I use the Learning Man Method almost every day to help CPA  Candidates eliminate ineffective study habits and focus only on what works.<br>
 <br>
This is crucial to your student&rsquo;s success because CPA review courses only  provide what the CPA candidate needs to know for the exam not how to <strong>actually  study</strong> and retain the information.<br>
<br>
Due to the fact that everyone learns differently the best place to start  identifying learning strengths and weaknesses is during accounting classes. <br>
<br>
There are 3 questions to ask in the Learning Man Method which I use to help CPA  candidates all over the world determine how they learn best.<br>
<br>
Have students take out a piece of paper and answer the following:<br>
<br>
<div class="steps" style="text-align:left">
  <p><strong>Question #1: </strong><br>
    Do you gain a better  understanding of accounting topics in class listening to lectures (visual/auditory learner) or on  your own via reading the text or completing questions (self-studier)? <br>
  <br>
  <strong>NOTE:</strong> Explain that this is important to know when determining whether to use a  live CPA review course or self-study<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Question #2:</strong> <br>
    Do you create your own  flashcards/outlines by hand? <br>
  <br>
    If yes, what % of time studying do you spend creating these resources? Do the  benefits received from creating these resources outweigh the time spent?<br>
  <br>
    If no, why not, are you able to quickly memorize definitions using your current  method?<br>
  <br>
    <strong>Challenge</strong>: Using trial and error see  what the most effective AND efficient method of memorizing definitions is.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Question #3:</strong> <br>
    Do you constantly review  your accounting materials throughout the semester? Or do you wait until the end  and cram? <br>
  <br>
    - If you constantly review everything you have learned do you find that it is  easier to study and actually recall what you have learned throughout the  semester? How much time do you spend reviewing every week?<br>
  <br>
    - If you are someone who crams do you find that you forget everything that you  have learned at the beginning of the semester by the time you get to final  exams? I challenge you to spend just 15 minutes a week reviewing everything you  have covered since the beginning of the semester.</p>
</div>
<p><br>
  By asking students these questions they will hopefully take a step back and  look at how their study habits are affecting their grades, time and overall  understanding of their courses.
  <h3><strong>Understanding How Each Student Learns Will Make It Easier To Identify Which CPA Review Course To Use</strong></h3>
  <p>If you can encourage them to experiment now to truly figure out what works best  for them it will make passing the CPA exam easier, less time-consuming, and  best of all more affordable (less CPA exam fees and less spent on CPA review  course materials).<br>
    <br>
    They will also be able to easily identify which CPA review course is going to  work best for them based on how they learn. <br>
    <br>

            PROBLEM</strong> <br>
            Students don&rsquo;t like to get bored, which will likely happen to them if they  don&rsquo;t become a CPA.<br>
            <strong><img src="images/cpa-exam-passrate/solution.jpg" width="50" height="50" alt=""/><br>
              SOLUTION</strong> <br>
              Use my 4 step Challenge Technique to reveal the types of jobs that  are available to CPAs and Non-CPAs and explain the differences.<br>
            <strong><img src="images/cpa-exam-passrate/time.png" width="50" height="50" alt=""/><br>
              ESTIMATED TIME</strong> <br>
              15-30 Minute Class Discussion</p>
        </div>
        <p><br>
I find the Challenge Technique to be effective for students who get bored  easily. <br>
<br>
Students who end up bypassing the CPA exam and public accounting and go into  private industry quickly find that the available accounting jobs become quite  monotonous and leaves the student feeling unfulfilled.<br>
<br>
This can be an amazing motivator for most young professionals looking to find a  way out of an accounting position that has turned into drudgery.<br>
<br>
This happened to me personally. During the economic crisis of 2008-2009 I was  able to find a basic accounting job after my public accounting firm let me go.  As a bookkeeper I found myself doing the same duties month after month and  within a year I had mastered my position and got bored. <br>
<br>
I used this boredom as  motivation to pass the CPA exam because I knew I was meant to do more with my  accounting career than just make the same journal entries every month.  <br>
<br>
Thankfully I was able to pass the CPA exam and within a month get hired by PwC  as an experienced auditor and I was once again challenged by my job!<br>
<br>
Unfortunately in college it is hard to create the same kind of motivation. <br>
<br>
The  best way I have found to help accounting students understand this fact is to  explain to them in college exactly what kind of jobs will be available if they  choose to skip the CPA exam and Public Accounting (and how little they pay!).<br>
<br>
Here is the step by step Challenger Technique worksheet that I use:<br>
        </p>
        <h3><strong>Step #1: Determine Your Students Career Goals </strong></h3>
<p>  Have student/professional write a list of goals for what they want out of their  accounting career and how they will use their degree to obtain it. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>NOTE:</strong> Be specific  – salary range, how much do they want to be challenged, do they want a  management role?<br>
  <br>
</p>
<h3><strong>Step #2: Provide list of jobs that don't require masters or CPA license</strong></h3>
<p>  Provide this list of typical jobs that non-CPAs can obtain in the private industry to your students:<br>
  <br>
  <strong>A/P Clerk </strong><br>
  Data entry position, cut checks and file invoices, typically hourly  pay <br>
  <br>
  <em>($13-16/hr or $23K-$41K/yr)</em><br>
  <br>
  <strong>A/R Clerk</strong><br>
  Process deposits from customers, work with customers to obtain  payments, typically hourly pay <br>
  <br>
  <em>($13-16/hr or $23K-$41K/yr)</em><br>
  <br>
  <strong>Payroll Clerk </strong><br>
  Process monthly payroll, managing hours clocked and payroll  data, and creating distributing payroll checks <br>
  <br>
  <em>($24K-$44K/yr)</em><br>
  <br>
  <strong>General Accountant/Book Keeper</strong><br>
  Salaried position, preparing monthly journals  and closing books monthly. <br>
  <br>
  <em>($22K-$55K/yr)</em><br>
  <br>
  <strong>Fixed Asset Accountant</strong><br>
  Manage fixed asset depreciation, adding and removing of assets<br>
  <br>
  <em>($45K-$50K/yr.)</em> - <a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/fixed-asset-accountant-salary-SRCH_KO0,22.htm" target="_blank">SOURCE</a><br>
<br>
  <strong>Cost Accountant </strong><br>
  Provide management with appropriate costing information, monitor process constraints, target costing projects, margin analysis and tracing costs back to underlying activities. - <a href="http://www.accountingtools.com/job-description-cost-accountan" target="_blank">SOURCE</a><br>
  <br>
  <em>($45K-$70K/yr.)</em><br>
  <br>
  <strong>Tax Accountant</strong><br>
  Prepare and file company tax returns (personal, corporate or government clients) also responsible for reducing tax liability and keeping up with latest regulations.<br>
  <br>
  <em>($51K-70K/yr salary)</em><br>
  <br>
  <strong>Treasury Analyst</strong><br>
  Handle company cash accounts, prepare monthly recs and company cash flow <br>
  <br>
  <em>($52K/yr entry level on average; earn as high as $90K/yr with experience)</em><br>
  <br>
  <strong>Government Accountant </strong><br>
  Use of fund accounting to focus on financial affairs of governmental organizations <br>
  <br>
  <em>($59K/yr on average)</em><br>
  <br>
  <strong>Assistant Controller </strong><br>
  Assist the controller in performing company accounting functions <br>
  <br>
  <em>($80K/yr avg salary)</em><br>
  <br>
  <h4><strong>Key Takeaway</strong></h4>
  <p>The key takeaway is that without public accounting or your CPA license, these  are entry level positions that will take 5-8 years to turn into management  level positions. Typically they are also only moderately paying jobs that  typically max out at $55K-$70K/yr. or less and involve performing the same  duties on a monthly, quarterly and yearly basis.<br>
    <br>
    Students should expect to master any of these positions within 3-5 years and  max out on added responsibilities fairly quickly if they are unable to make manager.<br>

  </p>
  <h3><strong>Step #3: Provide list of jobs that require public accounting experience and recommend a CPA license</strong></h3>
<p>  Show them the benefit of having public accounting experience and a CPA license by showing  them the jobs and salary levels that can be obtained after 2-8 years of public accounting  experience and/or becoming a licensed CPA. <br>
  <br>
  Here the list of popular positions that I use as part of The Challenger Technique:<br>
  <br>
  <strong>1) Cost Accountant Manager </strong><br>
  Manage all cost accounting activities and oversees the cost control systems, oversees cost audits, and prepares any cost accounting reports for upper management.<br>

<br>
<em>($99K/yr average salary)</em><br>
  <br>
  <strong>4) PHD Candidate/Professor</strong><br>
  After obtaining your masters in accounting you can enter a PHD program, but it helps to get public accounting experience and your CPA first. <br>
  <br>
  <em>Starting Accounting Professor salaries average $127K/yr.</em><br>
  <br>
  <strong>5)  Corporate Controller</strong><br>
Oversees all accounting aspects of the company including taxes, budget spend, and accounting department <br>

<h3><strong>Step #4: Devote time for students to research these jobs and create list of jobs that fit their career goals</strong></h3>
<p>  Encourage the student to research these jobs and find a job(s) that they think  will be a good fit for them based on what they wrote down in step #1. <br>
  <br>
  The goal being for them to connect the dots that if they are truly passionate  about accounting then they are going to need public accounting experience and  their CPA license in order to achieve them quickly. Or else they will risk  getting into a position that quickly becomes boring and takes years to evolve  into what they want to achieve.<br>

Along the lines of the <a href="#2">Incremental Growth Method</a>, I strongly encourage you to  share your personal stories of taking and passing the CPA Exam.<br>
<br>
If you are like me, the feeling of passing the CPA exam is on almost the same  level of getting married or holding your baby for the 1st  time! <br>
<br>
I remember exactly where I was, who I hugged, and who I high fived the instant  I clicked refresh on NASBA&rsquo;s website and saw my passing score.<br>

            Students don&rsquo;t understand how much they will have  to sacrifice in order to pass the CPA exam. <br>
            <strong><img src="images/cpa-exam-passrate/solution.jpg" width="50" height="50" alt=""/><br>
              SOLUTION</strong> <br>
              Instruct them to prioritize their life by listing what is more  important than becoming a CPA and what is less important<br>
            <strong><img src="images/cpa-exam-passrate/time.png" width="50" height="50" alt=""/><br>
              ESTIMATED TIME</strong> <br>
              15 minute class project</p>
        </div>
        <p><br>
No one likes giving up activities that he/she enjoys doing.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately this is the reality of taking the CPA exam. Students need to be  aware that for 6-9 months they will not be able to live a normal life. and t<br>
<br>
Tough  decisions will need to be made on where and how to spend their time.<br>
<br>
The best solution I have found in assisting students and CPA candidates make  these tough choices is to have them literally audit their life.<br>
<br>
List out all of their hobbies, time wasters, work schedule, social activities,  social media, TV shows, video games, planned vacations, family time, and finally the CPA  exam.<br>
<br>
Once they have written down everything they can think of, have them organize  their list based on importance compared to the CPA exam.<br>
<br>
If the activity is less important to them than passing the CPA exam then they  need to cut it from their life temporarily (or only partake in the activity as  a reward for accomplishing a CPA exam study goal).<br>
<br>
Here is the 3 step process for having your students complete their life audit:
<br>
<br>        
        <div class="steps" style="text-align:left">
          <p><strong>Step #1: The Life Audit </strong><br>
            <br>
          Have your students list out all of their hobbies, time wasters, work schedule, social activities, TV shows, video games, planned vacations, family time, and finally the CPA exam. <br>
          <br>
          Next, have them prioritize their list and determine which activities in their life are more important than becoming a CPA vs not as important. Rank them in numerical order. <br>
          <br>
          <strong>Step  #2: Create Plan To Make Necessary Sacrifices</strong><br>
          <br>
Now that they have <a href="https://www.cpaexamguide.com/learn/17-cpa-exam-motivation-hacks/" target="_blank">prioritized their life</a>, the next step is to determine what they  will be sacrificing when they begin studying for the CPA exam and how they will  use the priorities above the CPA exam as incentives to complete studying.<br>
<br>
<strong>Example:</strong> If cable TV is a huge time  waster, cancel your cable bill.<br>
<strong>Example 2:</strong> If your family is the #1  priority, set a study goal to complete by a specific day and if you complete it  go out and do something fun with your family etc…<br>
<br>
<strong>Step #3: Have them answer the following two questions<br>
</strong><br>
<strong>Question #1:</strong> What will you sacrifice in order to make time to study for the CPA exam?<br>
<br>
 <strong>Question #2:</strong> What will you use as incentives to make time to study for the CPA exam?          </p>
        </div>
        <p>  <br>
  After completing these steps, your students will begin to understand that it is  easy to compartmentalize their lives based on priority.<br>
  <br>
  By visually seeing what is important to them and not important, it will make  finding time to study much easier and the ability to make a routine will  hopefully naturally occur.<br>

With social media, Google and forums such as Another71.com or Reddit, students  have unlimited resources to research the CPA exam. <br>
<br>
Unfortunately there is so much negativity about the CPA exam process that it  may scare students away from even trying to take the CPA exam.<br>
<br>
By maintaining a positive atmosphere in the classroom and having an open and  honest dialogue with students about the CPA exam process will help any student who  is doubting the idea of sitting for the exam.<br>

The most common reasons I hear from students for not sitting for the CPA exam  and my typical responses are:<br>

            PROBLEM</strong> <br>
            Students don&rsquo;t understand what hiring managers are looking for on a resume.<br>
            <strong><img src="images/cpa-exam-passrate/solution.jpg" width="50" height="50" alt=""/><br>
              SOLUTION</strong> <br>
              Help students understand what HR looks for when hiring new employees  out of college AND more importantly how hiring works after being in the job market  for several years<br>
            <strong><img src="images/cpa-exam-passrate/time.png" width="50" height="50" alt=""/><br>
              ESTIMATED TIME</strong> <br>
              15-20 minute presentation, include career services</p>
        </div>
        <p><br>
As someone who recruited on campuses for PwC and BKD for 3 years and has worked for several different companies, I know exactly what HR is looking for when it comes to  finding potential interns/1st year associates and experienced  professionals.<br>
<br>
This is also why I believe that the Man Behind The Curtain Technique is so  crucial to motivating students to take the CPA exam!<br>
<br>
You need to reveal to your students that Accounting Hiring Managers care about  3 core items on a resume:<br>
<br><div class="steps">
  <p>1) GPA<br>
    2) Sufficient experience<br>
    3) Do you have your CPA</p>
</div>
<p><br>
  Remind students that if they match all 3 of these requirements, they will  almost be guaranteed to make the cut for an office interview.<br>
  <br>
  Without a CPA license it makes it difficult to obtain the experience they need  and if their GPA is lacking the CPA is a perfect way to make up for it.<br>

            Fear of failure is preventing students from even taking the CPA Exam.<br>
            <strong><img src="images/cpa-exam-passrate/solution.jpg" width="50" height="50" alt=""/><br>
              SOLUTION</strong> <br>
              Show students that failure is okay and actually part of the design of  the CPA exam!<br>
            <strong><img src="images/cpa-exam-passrate/time.png" width="50" height="50" alt=""/><br>
              ESTIMATED TIME</strong> <br>
              10-15 minute student project</p>
        </div>
        <p><br>
          Accounting students have a stereotype that includes being driven over-achievers,  super book smart and most of all students who never fail! <br>
<br>
Unfortunately <a href="http://goingconcern.com/post/you-have-1-5-chance-passing-all-4-cpa-exam-parts-first-try" target="_blank">80% of CPA candidates fail at least one section of the CPA exam</a> and it&rsquo;s this reality, this fear of failure, which causes accounting students  to delay even sitting for the CPA exam.<br>
<br>
Take Heather for example:<br>
</p>
        <div class="state-button-center" ><img src="images/cpa-exam-passrate/fear-of-failure-example.jpg" alt="" width="467" height="97" class="img-responsive"/></div>
        <p><br>
          By using what I call my &ldquo;Why Do We Fall Strategy&rdquo; I was able  to help her overcome her fear of failing!<br>
          <br>
I developed this strategy because I failed all 4 sections of the CPA exam in a  row… and I was CRUSHED. <br>
<br>
I was literally inches from giving up on the CPA exam because of <a href="retake-failed-cpa-exam-section">how much I  HATED failing</a>. Thankfully I lost my first job due to the economy  and it knocked some real world sense into me. <br>
<br>
I focused on becoming mentally  determined to pass the CPA exam so that I could get my career back on track.<br>
<br>
It was during these dark hours that I unwittingly created the &ldquo;Why Do We Fall  Strategy.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
I was sitting in my apartment asking myself: <br>
<br>
<em>How did I go from a student with a 3.6 overall GPA with a full time audit position lined up before  I even graduated to being someone with barely enough money in my bank account  to pay rent?</em><br>
<br>
It was at this point that I took out a sheet of paper and wrote out 3 reason I  wanted to become a CPA:<br>
<br>
<div class="steps">
  <p><strong>Reason #1</strong><br> 
    I want to be a CPA to be able to provide for my future family.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Reason #2<br>
    </strong>I want to be a CPA so that I can show employers that I do not give up and  that I am willing to dedicate my life to completing a task, no matter how  impossible it feels.<br>
    <strong><br>
    Reason #3</strong><br>
     I want to be a CPA so that I don't get stuck in a dead end job and be bored  out of my mind!</p>
</div>
<br>
<p>And three goals I couldn&rsquo;t accomplish in my career without passing the CPA exam:</p>
<strong><br>
</strong>
<div class="steps">
  <p><strong>Goal #1</strong> <br>
    Job security<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Goal #2</strong><br>
Fast track to manager/VP<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Goal #3</strong><br>
    Start my own company</p>
</div>
<p><br>
  I kept this sheet of paper in front of me whenever I was studying as a constant  reminder why it was worth failing over and over until I passed and the end  result was passing 2 sections back to back and finding a job within 2 months.<br>
  <br>
  I strongly urge you to start asking your students to start thinking about WHY  they want to become a CPA and what they CAN&rsquo;T accomplish without passing the  CPA exam.<br>
  <br>
  This sheet of paper is going to get them mentally prepared to take the CPA exam  and it will (hopefully) erase the fear of failure that might be holding them  back.<br>

              Help students understand the thought process behind how the AICPA  crafts the CPA exam.<br>

 As you already know, it isn't in the AICPA's best interest for 100% of CPA candidates to pass the CPA exam.<br>

Since we are on the front-lines with students it is our responsibility to get  them prepared for the CPA exam, which is why I use &ldquo;The Busy Season Simulator&rdquo;  to help students prepare for what lies ahead.<br>
<br>
How to share &ldquo;The Busy Season Simulator&rdquo; in 5 steps<br></p>
<br>
<div class="steps">
  <p><strong>Step #1<br>
    </strong>Don&rsquo;t sugar coat the facts, explain to your students that only 20% of  CPA candidates pass the CPA exam without failing a single section. In fact  failure is part of the design of the exam.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Step #2<br>
  </strong>Reveal the reason for such a low pass rate is the AICPA wants the pool of CPAs to be  the most dedicated and motivated accountants. If everyone passed the CPA exam  then it would lose its prestige. Remember if everyone is a winner than no one  is a winner.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Step #3<br>
  </strong>Remind your students that even the design of the CPA exam is to  mirror the intensity of busy season. Public accounting firms understand that if  you can handle the intensity of passing the CPA exam then you will have the  mental fortitude to succeed during busy season.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Step #4</strong><br>
    Now share the good news that the CPA exam is NOT an IQ exam. It  doesn&rsquo;t test anything that you haven&rsquo;t already covered in college, so if you  can graduate you can pass the CPA exam no matter what your GPA. Do NOT think  that because you failed a section of the CPA exam you are not intelligent, that  is NOT true!<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Step #5<br>
  </strong> Explain that the CPA exam is all about being mentally prepared (refer  to the <a href="#11">Why Do We Fall Strategy</a>), having a study system based on routine (refer  to <a href="#13">Power Up Strategy</a>), and being willing to make the necessary sacrifices in  order to make time to study (refer to <a href="#8">The Life Audit</a>). Without having an understanding of these concepts your students' odds of passing the CPA exam will drop drastically. </p>
</div><br>
<h3><strong>Your Goal Using the Busy Season Simulator Method</strong></h3>
<p>These 5 steps will help you be up front and honest with your students. <br>
  <br>
  The goal  is not to scare them but to help get them mentally prepared for what is coming  next, and hopefully alleviate some of the fears they have about taking the CPA exam.<br>

            PROBLEM</strong> <br>
            Students treat the CPA Exam like a normal college exam.<br>
            <strong><img src="images/cpa-exam-passrate/solution.jpg" width="50" height="50" alt=""/><br>

              Teach students the right way to study for the CPA Exam that actually  works and helps them avoid trial and error.<br>

              25-30 minute class presentation</p>
        </div>
        <p><br>
 A common misconception that I see brand new CPA candidates make is that they  think they can study for the CPA exam exactly the same way as a college exam.<br>
<br>
<strong>Examples:</strong><br>
1) Go to class all semester and then cram in the last couple weeks before the  final exam, or<br>
2) Make copious handwritten notes, flashcards or other time consuming manual  study methods, or <br>
3) My personal favorite, studying just to pass the exam and NOT to actually  gain an understanding of the material.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, these examples are the reason for a HUGE % of candidates  failing! <br>
<br>
This is why teaching the &ldquo;CPA Exam Power Up Strategy&rdquo; is crucial to your students  success:<br>
<br><div class="steps">
  <p><strong>Step #1:</strong> <br>
    Help students understand that the only way to pass the CPA exam is to  truly UNDERSTAND the core concepts their CPA review course teaches them as  opposed to just doing the same multiple choice questions over and over and  memorizing the answers.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Step #2: </strong><br>
    Explain that the CPA exam is all about maximizing their short term  memory. They will need to cram the equivalent of a semesters worth of studying  into 8-12 weeks. More on this in step #3.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Step #3:<br>
  </strong> In order to maximize their short term memory, students will need to be  constantly learning and constantly reviewing. By doing this they will be able  to get through massive amounts of material and still keep the information in  chapter 1 as fresh as the final chapter. The goal being that as the information  taught by the CPA review course builds on each other, the student will gain a  better understanding of the material.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Step #4: </strong><br>
    Share the importance of making time to study and creating a routine no  matter what their work/school schedule. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>EXAMPLES:</strong> Study for 15 minutes before work, 30 minutes during lunch, listen to  MP3 audio lectures on your commute, work out, eat dinner, and study until 10  pm, do something you enjoy for 30 minutes, and go to bed and repeat.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Step #5:</strong> <br>
    Before sitting for each exam, explain the importance of having a final  review in the 8-14 days prior to each exam. This is a period where they stop  trying to learn new material and focus 100% on review and strengthening their  weakest areas.</p>

        PROBLEM</strong> <br>
        Students pick accounting as a major, but aren't sure how to be passionate about accounting other than the fact that they can make good money.<br>
          <strong><img src="images/cpa-exam-passrate/solution.jpg" width="50" height="50" alt=""/><br>
          SOLUTION</strong> <br>
          Find something that your students are passionate about and help them  realize how accounting and the CPA exam is going to help them achieve this  passion.<br>
          <strong><img src="images/cpa-exam-passrate/time.png" width="50" height="50" alt=""/><br>
          ESTIMATED TIME</strong> <br>
          15 minute project and class discussion</p></div><br>

<p>Do you have students who picked accounting as their major but aren't sure why?<br>
  <br>
  I have found many students pick accounting as their major because they hear it is a safe career and that they can make good money.
  <br>
  <br>
  Unfortunately picking a safe career can mean that you are not passionate about your career.
<br>
<br>
This is why I developed the Passion Project Formula.<br>
<br>
If you are going to persuade your students to take the CPA exam then you MUST  help them identify what they are passionate about and how accounting/the CPA  exam is going to help them achieve this passion.<br>
<br>
Once they connect the two then they will be willing to put in the necessary  time and effort to pass the CPA exam. <br>
<br>
Here is the simple 3 step formula to helping your students identify their  passion project and how accounting is going to help them achieve this goal:<br>
<br><div class="steps" >
  <p><strong>Step #1: Identify Passion Project<br>
    </strong>Help them determine passion by asking &ldquo;If he/she  had a million dollars to put into a passion project (starting a business, a cause,  a hobby) what would that be.&rdquo;<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Step #2: Big Picture Question<br>
  </strong>How is accounting going to help them accomplish  their passion project? <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Step #3: Push The CPA Exam<br>
</strong>How much quicker would becoming a CPA help them  achieve this goal? <br>
<br>
Help the student identify obstacles in achieving their  passion project and how becoming a CPA and the experience that would come with  it will assist them in achieving their goals.</p>
</div>
<h3><strong>Passion In Accounting</strong></h3>
  <p>The ultimate goal of the passion project formula is to increase your student&rsquo;s  motivation and help them become passionate about accounting. <br>
    <br>
    Once they have connected the dots between their passion and accounting they will be much more likely to take the CPA exam and gain the experience they need to accomplish their goals.<br>

            PROBLEM</strong> <br>
            With growing competition, students who decide not to pursue the CPA will have difficulty specializing without obtaining some form of professional certification.<br>

              SOLUTION</strong> <br>
              Teach students that employees with letters after their name are  more sought after and that there are certifications for every type of specialization in accounting.<br>

          If all else fails remind them that the  CPA exam is not for everyone, but that there are other options. <br>
<br>
As an accountant, learning and improving of oneself doesn&rsquo;t end after college. <br>
<br>
There are several other relevant certifications that make sense to pursue when  the CPA exam isn&rsquo;t an option:<br>
        <h3><strong>Other Top Tier Certification</strong></h3>
        <p>Certified Managerial Accounting (CMA) Exam: If public accounting doesn&rsquo;t  interest a student, remind them that the CMA exam is for anyone looking to get  into the private industry. It focuses on the financial analysis and budgeting  side of accounting. -<br>
